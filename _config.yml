about_me_description: "Hello! I'm Bryce, an IT professional with experience in system administration, infrastructure management, and network operations. As a detail-oriented individual with a passion for excellence, I am adept at formulating and developing target-oriented IT roadmaps and strategies as well as defining vision in compliance with up-to-date industry standards/guidelines. What makes me stand out are my abilities in developing and deploying robust solutions aimed at pinpointing and promptly troubleshooting system issues. I am an out-of-the-box thinker and creative problem-solver with exceptional leadership, communication, relationship-building, and analytical skills.
Throughout my career, I have remained a resourceful and results-driven professional with a solid record in leading varied technical projects from conception to successful completion while achieving targeted milestones within defined scope, timeframe, and quality. I also have proven success in implementing systems, documenting system/process changes, installing hardware, standing up software solutions, and integrating new systems into existing systems. 
I believe that my experience and progressive career path will be helpful in achieving the main objectives of an organization. I am passionate about tackling new challenges and opportunities where I employ my technical skills and experiences at a higher strategic level. I am confident that my wide range of knowledge and talents allow me to contribute to the success of the companies I work with. While others take pride in meeting all standards set before them, my passion is for delivering service and leadership that goes beyond organizational expectations."
